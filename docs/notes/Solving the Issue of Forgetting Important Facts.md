I have noticed in my short life that many people are stuck doing things inefficiently because optimizing the problem takes too much effort to be worthwhile. For example - students forget a lot of what they have learned in class. The brain is an amazing organ - it's great at processing information what color is your shirt? - takes nearly zero effort to determine, but remembering things for long periods is much harder: what did you eat for breakfast yesterday?

Interestingly despite this well-known fact, nobody has come up with an elegant solution to this problem, instead opting to hammer the knowledge into people's heads for years with pain and suffering. 

I would suggest that the most important things that students learn in college boil down to training the brain on how to approach a problem. Perhaps this isn't true for all majors, but it does appear to be true for mine. 

I have grown frustrated with needing to recall knowledge and find memorizing facts - separate from concepts and ideas) to be tedious and painful. 

What if, instead of teaching about the American Revolution; give people a list of terms such as the French Revolution, the American Revolution, and the Spanish Inquisition? Have them write down some key facts about each, and then use the class period to discuss how they affected each other? I'd recommend against assigning a textbook because that limits the variety of knowledge the students will gather. Give bonus points for unique and unusual facts that they dig up. 

This method would be great, except that most of the students will promptly throw that piece of paper away or put it in a binder and forget it exists. They won't remember any of the details except the most surprising ones, and it will be almost as though you never had a class. 

What if, instead of throwing the paper away, students integrated it into a digital brain, containing detailed notes on the terms? that way, in the future, they could easily and quickly search for the term, and pull up their exact thoughts about it from many years ago when it was fresh on their mind? Would it not be even better than the greatest possible lecture? What if I told you that this system already exists, that I have been using it for several months, and that I have had great success with Obsidian? 

I believe that a combination of online wiki software, with the Zettelkasten method results in a sort of digital brain that stores highly detailed information about the things you have learned, and provides extremely quick access for any future needs. the only drawback is that it takes a significant overhead to input everything into this system. I have seen my typing speed increase from 60wpm to 85 wpm in 3 months and it's still not enough to keep up. I believe the solution to this is to reinvent the keyboard - potentially using Charachorder - a new system that claims to let people type at 300 wpm. I use Obsidian- a digital wiki that stores its notes in Md format. I plan on spending the summer optimizing my Obsidian knowledgebase and researching better ways to type faster.

I would argue that in this digital age, information is basically free, but a lot of the free information is either low level and missing important details, or simply diluted with fluff. I would also say that if you have information that not everyone else has - say research, that is very valuable, and it turns out that creating nuggets of knowledge that exist forever and are highly useful later, in a way add value to your future.

Zettelkasten method - a way of storing information - was invented by a German scholar who wrote 60 books without any help. 
Charachorder - keyboard for the 21st century
digital wiki - a platform like Wikipedia, but for your individual use
Obsidian - the digital wiki that I have chosen to use, due to being private and easily exportable. 

If this interests you, you should also check out my essay on [[The Theory and Optimization of Thinking along with Problem Solving Philosophy]], as I believe these things go hand in hand. 

#### notes:
I'm not happy with the flow, it needs to be refactored before I publish it, I also need to add references, and get some peer/professor review.
